##Overview
Crafting+ Reloaded is an open-source forked plugin to add new crafting recipes to existing non-craftable items in vanilla Minecraft. This plugin is intended for survival servers that want to give their players more freedom for their crafting needs to stop them having to go hunting for those music discs in dungeons or packed ice in new biomes.
